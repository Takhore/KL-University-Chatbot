KL UNIVERSITY (KLEF) - FRESHER STUDENT KNOWLEDGE BASE
1. COLLEGE TIMINGS & SHIFTS

1st Year B.Tech Students: Classes run strictly from 7:20 AM to 1:40 PM.

4th Year B.Tech Students: Classes also run from 7:20 AM to 1:40 PM.

2nd & 3rd Year B.Tech Students: Classes run from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

Non-Engineering (BBA, BCA, etc.): Typically follow a 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM or 5:00 PM schedule depending on lab work.

Sundays are strict holidays. Lunch breaks are usually 50 minutes.

2. ATTENDANCE RULES & PERCENTAGES

The Minimum Requirement: The university mandates an 85% attendance rate for all programs (except Law, which is 70%).

The 75% Hard Cutoff: Students must maintain a minimum of 75% attendance to write the Semester-End Examinations.

Condonation (Medical/Sports): If attendance falls between 75% and 85%, the university may grant "condonation" (forgiveness) if the student provides valid medical certificates or proof of representing the university in sports/fests (OD - On Duty leave).

Below 75%: If attendance drops below 75% (or 65% for Law), the student is strictly detained. No excuses are accepted below this threshold.

Attendance Marks: Students with attendance above 85% receive bonus internal marks (e.g., 85-88% = 1 mark, 98-100% = 5 marks).

3. L-T-P-S WEIGHTAGE IN ATTENDANCE

Courses are broken down into L-T-P-S components: Lecture, Tutorial, Practical, and Skill.

Calculation: Attendance is calculated cumulatively across all these components, not just theory. Missing a 2-hour Practical (P) class will drop your percentage much faster than missing a 1-hour Lecture (L). You must attend all components to maintain your overall subject attendance.

4. WHAT TO DO IF DETAINED

Being detained means you failed to meet the 75% attendance mark or the 40% internal marks requirement for a specific subject.

Consequence: You will receive a "Not Attended" (NA) or "Fail" (F) grade and will not be allowed to write the final exam for that subject.

Solution: You cannot simply rewrite the exam. You must re-register for the entire course, usually during the Summer Term, pay a re-registration fee, and attend the classes again to clear the backlog.

5. HOW TO APPLY FOR LEAVE & USE ERP

ERP Portal: All university administration is handled through the KLU ERP portal (newerp.kluniversity.in).

Short Leaves (Under 1 week): Must be applied for via the ERP portal and approved by your class counselor and Head of Department (HoD) before you take the leave.

Long Leaves/Medical: Requires physical submission of medical certificates to the HoD and Dean of Academics immediately upon returning.

Hostel Leave: You must separately inform your Hostel Warden/Superintendent before leaving the campus, or it is considered a breach of discipline.

6. GRADING SYSTEM & HOW TO CALCULATE CGPA

KLU uses a 10-point grading scale: O (10), A+ (9), A (8), B+ (7), B (6), C (5), F (0 for Fail).

Passing Marks: You need a minimum CGPA of 4.5 to graduate B.Tech (5.5 for M.Tech).

CGPA to Percentage Formula: If you need to write your percentage on a resume, use the official KLU conversion formula:
Percentage = (10 x CGPA) - 7.5
(Example: A CGPA of 8.0 would be (10 x 8.0) - 7.5 = 72.5%)

7. CAMPUS PLACEMENTS

KLU boasts a near 100% placement rate for eligible students. To be eligible, you usually must have zero active backlogs and a CGPA above a certain threshold (often 6.75+).

Super Dream Offers: Packages above ₹20 LPA (e.g., Amazon, JP Morgan).

Dream Offers: Packages between ₹10 LPA and ₹18 LPA.

Mass Recruiters: Packages between ₹6 LPA and ₹9 LPA (e.g., TCS, Cognizant, Deloitte).
